# Login - Access to the system

The purpose of this page is to help you understand login concepts. As a result of reading this page, you should be able to log into iDempiere.
Navigation in Idempiere is one of the great benefits that it offers since its interface is very
friendly, it allows configuration in multiple languages and when placing the mouse pointer
on each of its icons or buttons, it clearly shows the name and/or role it plays. To enter the
system you may use any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Explorer ...) by entering the URL
provided. For optimum performance navigating the system with Google Chrome.

## Login to the system - Authentication

The first step of the login process focuses on authentication (who are you) and language preference.

You have to enter your User name and a Password. It must be correct including look at capital and small letters.

If you want to select a role you have to tick the box. In the following dialoge you can also specify an Organizational unit, Warehouse or a Date for your entries.
To enter Idempiere simply enter the URL assigned in any internet browser,
there you must enter User and Password provided by the administrator of the Idempiere
system. Then select the desired system language from the drop down options.

If you use the GardenWorld demonstration client you can use either
the User

- GardenAdmin with the password = GardenAdmin or
- GardenUser with the also the same word as password.

The Role and in some circumstances the Tenant dictate how the system will behave once you are logged in. Chose the [Tenant](vocabulary#tenant) and [Role](vocabulary#role). Let's review the authorization fields and how they impact your session.
